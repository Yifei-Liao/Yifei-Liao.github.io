I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in accounting at the UCI Paul Merage School of Business and am on the 2024-25 accounting job market. Broadly speaking, my research explores the impact of accounting information, particularly from a financial accounting perspective. 

My dissertation, “Mandatory Pay Range Disclosures and Firm Information Environment,” investigates how the mandatory disclosure of pay range information influences corporate voluntary disclosures and information asymmetry. Given that the impact of information depends on the quality and feature of the content, I am also interested in using advanced techniques to characterize these aspects. In addition to my interest in utilizing advanced ML algorithms to refine accounting measurements, I am also fascinated by the impact of AI and technology on investors’ use of financial information. The impact of information also depends on users’ capabilities. I am particularly interested in how behavioral bias moderates the impact of information through information acquisition or integration process.
