I'm currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in accounting at the UCI Paul Merage School of Business. My main research interests include the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), including ChatGPT, on investors' usage of financial information. Additionally, I am interested in topics related to disclosure, human capital, and limited attention. I hold a bachelor’s degree from Northeastern University (China) and master’s degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and the University of California, San Diego.
