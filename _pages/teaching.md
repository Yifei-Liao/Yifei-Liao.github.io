## Student Feedback for Managerial Accounting

"Professor Liao's strength is that he spends a lot of time helping students comprehend and use the knowledge we learned in the lecture. In every lecture, he creates many Kahoot sessions, which provide many practice chances and questions, helping students understand. By using Kahoot sessions, he creates an interactive environment where students can actively engage with the material. This method not only reinforces the concepts taught but also allows for immediate feedback, which is crucial for understanding complex topics in managerial accounting. For each specific topic, he starts with an example and continues the teaching by processing the 'assumed company.' It bridges the gap between theory and practical application, which is essential in a subject like managerial accounting, where real-world application is key."

"Professor Liao stimulates the students to use their brain every day within the course. He ensures that students show up to class, unlike other classes I've been in. He is passionate about teaching and relays the information in a way that all students can grasp it and allows for students to ask questions during the lectures. He offers a clear explanation so that other students can understand as well. The slides he creates are informative and clear. Announcements are also easily accessible to all. Emails are answered rapidly, professionally, and with clear answers. He is understanding and genuinely cares to help the students learn."

"The instructor demonstrates remarkable patience, making even the most complex topics approachable and understandable. Their sense of humor brings a refreshing and engaging atmosphere to the classroom, making learning enjoyable. The instructor genuinely cares about the students, always taking the time to ensure everyone feels supported and understood. They actively encourage participation, creating an inclusive environment where every student's voice is valued. This approach not only fosters a deeper understanding of the material but also builds a strong sense of community within the class."

"Professor Liao's Teaching Strengths:
- Extremely organized course website and slides
- Slides are very easy to read and understand, which is extremely helpful and makes them a wonderful study resource when preparing for exams
- Has discussion forums and keeps a class email open for questions and concerns, which has been extremely helpful for me
- Encourages students to think beyond the limitations of the course (i.e., incorporating the growth and popularity of AI into course material, etc.)"
